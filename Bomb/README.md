### Resume
Welcome to Bomberman's cave.\
This is a 2d game which goal is to kill all the enemies, stay alive and win.\
You win the game after you kill all the enemies and lose if an enemy catch you or you blow yourself up.\
Be smart and fast, place the bomb's on the right places's and try to stay alive. \
You have to be very careful because there are enemies that will try to kill you.

The game starts and prints the board which is 10x10 and spawn 4 enemies on random positions(except the blocks around the player so he can make atleast 1 move).
You can upgrade the board and make it 11x11 or 12x12 and also increase enemies and make them 5 or 6.
There are 3 types of floor - breakable, unbreakable and ordinary floor on which player moves. The breakable are the brown squares, every time you start the game they spawn randomly and you can brake them if you put a bomb next to them. Unbreakable are the gray ones and every time you start the game they spawn on the same place.
After you place the bomb you have 4 seconds until it blows up(it blows 1 block away from the position you place it (it can only destroy breakable blocks, kill enemies, and kill you, can't destroy the grey blocks)).
The enemies moves randomly between blocks.
